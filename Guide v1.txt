Satellaview+ on Pi guide. 

Works full speed with lots of overhead on the Pi4 with working
streamed Soundlink+ Audio.

0. Before starting, make sure you have a recent version of Snes9x, with RGBPi-Extra you can update the core with the provided update script.

1. Access the Pi terminal through Putty on Windows 
(Using your Pi IP address, port 22 and logging in as user:root + password:(rgbpigod for this project))

2. To allow traffic on port 8384 through the Raspberry Pi's firewall (UFW), you'll need to use 
the UFW allow command in the terminal. First, ensure UFW is installed and enabled. 
Then, use the ufw allow 8384/tcp command to allow incoming connections on that port. 

Run these commands in the terminal (Putty is a great way to access it on a PC),
do them in order and let each command finish, the update can take some time.

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install ufw
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow 8384/tcp

(optional:
sudo ufw status)

3. Install the audio stream player:
sudo apt install mpv -y

4. Download and install Syncthing for Windows (open-source home-network file syncing program)
https://syncthing.net/downloads/
Make sure it's allowed in your firewall.

5. Install Syncthing on the Pi:
sudo apt install syncthing -y

Then edit the config for syncthing in the terminal with this line:
nano ~/.config/syncthing/config.xml


Look for a section like this:
<gui>
	<address>127.0.0.1:8384</address>

Change it to all 0's before the 8384 part:
<gui>
	<address>0.0.0.0:8384</address>
	
hit shift+O to write out the changes to the config file.


6. Download and setup the Satellaview+ client on Windows:
https://satellaviewplus.github.io/connect.htm

Launch satellaview+ (v4 at the time of writing) and hit the "edit config" button.
Select "RetroArch" and give it an adress to the location, it can be whatever you want
as long as it has the following folder structure roms>snes>bs-x

For example create folders to have the following path on your PC 
"C:\satplus\roms\snes\bs-x"

Then in the edit config select "satplus" as your emulator folder.
Restart the client after making this change.

Satellaview+ data will then end up in the bs-x folder. It'll say "downloading SatData and tell if the
satellaview+ data is up to date. Make sure the bs-x folder contains the "BS-X.sfc" rom, which should be the 
english translated Satellaview "BS-X town" interface.

As long as the Satellaview+ client is running, it will continue to get satellaview data and update
game content on the fly. Be sure to check the "Broadcast Schedule" and the "Soundlink+ Schedule" to see
when live streamed Satellaview audio content is available.

The client need to be running on your PC for Satellaview+ to work live on the Pi.
Optional:
Set the pi time the same time as the Satellaview+ Server (time shown in the Satellaview+ Windows Client):
 sudo raspi-config

7. Start Syncthing on the Pi through terminal (Putty) with the following line:

syncthing

(If you want to stop Syncthing, hit ctrl+c in the Putty terminal to stop it from running)

Make sure Syncthing is running on the Pi for the next steps.

8. Start Syncthing on the Windows PC 
- Start menu>Start Syncthing
- Start menu>Syncthing Configuration Page

This will open a browser page where you can configure it.

- Set user and password to: root and whatever you want as the password
- Delete default shared folder
- Click "Add Folder"
- Give it a "Folder Label" (for example BSX)
- Give it a "Folder Path", if you followed the example then this would be "C:\satplus\roms\snes\bs-x"
- In the Avanced tab, set the folder type to "Send & Receive"
- In the Avanced tab, set rescan interval to 1 second, to make it continually sync Satellaview+ data to the Pi
- Save, "BSX" will show up and it'll blink "Up to Date" as it keeps checking the files
- Add your Pi (make sure it's running Syncthing) as a remote device
(the device ID for the Pi is written out in the Putty terminal)
- Give it a device name, "Pi" and save

9: Then in a separate brower tab, go to the Pi's Syncthing configuration page.
Use the following address to access it, replace "192.168.1.163" with the IP for your Pi. 
http://192.168.1.163:8384

Accept the shared devices and make the path to this for the pi
(accept the device requests both for Syncthing PC and Syncthing Pi)

The Pi Syncthing will now also have the BSX folder, shared with PC.
Make sure it's set set to "Send & Receive" and has a rescan interval of 1s in the Advanced Tab.

Set the path for the Pi to: "/media/usb1/roms/snes/bs-x"
(makes the satellaview data download to the USB1 drive)

Make sure the folder ID to the same as the Windows folder ID
In the share tab, check the box for "DESKTOP-XXXXXXX" to make it share with windows

Now the satellaview+ client data downloads will be passed over to the Pi as the bs-x folders are
synced up through your network. 
Snes9x (updated to the latest core with RGBPi-Extra) will  


10: To manually (Putty terminal) start playing Satellaview+ with Soundlink+ audio on the pi.
An automatic Pi launcher script will be available soon. But for now manually do it in Putty.

PC: 
- Start Syncthing
- Start the Satellaview+ client
(give it a moment for it to download the client data)

Pi:
- Go to your SNES roms (Scan for games first on RGBPi, 
only needed the first time doing this to make the bs-x folder to show)
- Go to the new "bs-x" folder and launch the "BS-X.sfc" rom that should be there.
This will start the Satellaview BS-X BIOS with snes9x as the core.

- If there's Soundlink+, then start the audio stream with the following command in terminal:

nohup mpv https://howlingf-gecko.radioca.st/stream --no-video &> /dev/null &

The stream audio will play in the background at the same time as the SNES audio, both played on the Pi.
If Syncthing is running on the Pi you can end it with "ctrl-c", do the audio command then run
Syncthing again.

To start Syncthing on the Pi:

syncthing

If you want to end the Audio Stream:

pkill mpv

11: With the provided scripts you won't need to use Putty again. 
Copy the "# StartSatellaview+.sh" and "# StopSatellaview+sh" scripts over to the "scripts" folder on the USB drive.
To play, go to the scripts item in the Pi menu (scan for games if it's not there), run the Start .sh script.

Then go to the BS-X.sfc rom that's located in "roms/snes/bs-x/" just like loading any other SNES ROM.

It will work as long as you have the Satellaview+ client and Syncthing running on a computer in your home-network.

To adjust the volume of the game (not the SoundLink+ stream), access the RetroArch quick menu then
"back to main menu>settings>audio>volume gain" and set it to a lower or higher value in order to adjust the balance.

If errors are encountered, delete the .bin files from the PC bs-x folder (exampple "C:\satplus\roms\snes\bs-x") then
hit the "Download Again" button in the Satellaview+ PC Client.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Be sure to check the SoundLink+ broadcasting schedule, as the addon audio isn't broadcasted every day.
When there is a SoundLink+ broadcast happening then the SNES music can sometimes be muted while soundeffects are kept.
(not all games are made to do this, usually it's the game in the main broadcast station, this is a work in progress 
feature and more sfx only games will be available over time)
