# Pi-Satellaview-Plus
This guide is for making Satellaview+ playable on a Raspberry Pi that is set up for emulation. 
Confirmed to be working with the RGBPi-Extra fork which allows for a lot of extra customization. https://github.com/forkymcforkface/RGBPi-Extra
It may also work with other Pi images that aren't CRT specific as long as they allow for root access, updating cores and launching scripts.

What is Satellaview+?
Satellaview+ is a revival project that aims to bring back the 1995 Japan only broadcasting service for the Super Famicom.
The game and audio broadcasts are instead done through the internet rather than satellite. Bringing back old preserved content, recreating lost content that was recorded 
and bringing in new content as well, all in English. 

There's a lot of plans for this revival like special events, join the Satellaview+ discord to keep up-to-date. https://satellaviewplus.github.io/
